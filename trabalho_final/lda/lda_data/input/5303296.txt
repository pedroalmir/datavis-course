reading dicom files create binary matrix currently working dicom files contain dicom dose delivery data structure set files mainly interested structure set file rtss dcm contains set contour points roi interest particular contour points surround tumor volume instance tumor set contour contour set points encircle slice tumor trying matlab contour points construct tumor volume binary matrix nontumor tumor help possible approach fill contour set binary slouse interpolate volume slice fill patch function create binary cross section contour slouse having difficulty figuring interpolate binary slice volume built functions appear apply particular problem wrong simple linear interpolation doesn appropriate edge contour blend adjacent contour direction option take point tesselate making slice 1st don know make matlab tesselate surface tumor intersecting tumor volume currently find triangle tumor surface sure take convert binary matrix volume experience slice interpolation tesselation technique apply relevant toolkit exist stuck open approach language familiar python assumed matlab handle matrix operation easier thanks advance
