changing cnn work convolution working code creates gan trying apply new domain switching application mnist brain mri image issue defining gan example code defining generative model takes noise dimension dim produces image mnist distribution 28x28 comment based believe works code niftynet convolutional layer dim latent dim added results print statement sure able currently error relatively new building nns questions point latent space compact representation space decide size output dimension 2nd parameter layer looking successful implementation cnn inspiration thank major edit made progress got tensorflow run code batch size running memory error try run training operation calculated image size bit pixel data causing memory error basically tweaked gan parameter worked issue probably file
