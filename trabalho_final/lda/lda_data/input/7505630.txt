decoding jpeg image bit precision silverlight fjcore library silverlight application trying decode dicom images compressed jpeg transfer syntax class library dicom image normally compressed bit precision trying decode image original fjcore source code saying unsupported codec type original fjcore implementation sof0 baseline dct sof2 progressive dct start frame marker supported change implementation accept sof1 marker extended sequential dct treat sof1 frame way sof0 frames image decoded bits accounted typical bit precision image looks decoding modified fjcore library ideally image look able tell fjcore implementation image precision recorded jpegframe class original fjcore implementation fully support grayscale image bit precision planning take bull horn try extend fjcore support bit precision grayscale image thought pose question stackoverflow encountered solved problem case happy learn solved problem thanks advance anders cureo
