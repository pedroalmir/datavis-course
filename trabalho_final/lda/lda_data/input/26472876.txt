search parameter sort deviceobservationreport given resource deviceobservationreport number field cardinality case contain reference resource cardinality having considerable difficulty deciding support chained query referenced resource steps deep better term example single deviceobservationreport multiple observation resource reference entirely probable client wish perform query requests instances observation specific code timestamp appliesdate later specific instant time named search parameter observation appear obvious starting point path observation specified virtualdevice channel metric observation given virtualdevice channel metric field cardinality simple query retrieve deviceobservationreport instance contain observation code testcode observed later october look data deviceobservationreport virtualdevice channel metric observation name testcode virtualdevice channel metric observation date secondly client request result set sorted date expressed query various attempts made implement point support query complex able come satisfactory solution
