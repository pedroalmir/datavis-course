issue roc curve test positive threshold working evaluating screening test osteoporosis large set data measured values bone density classified individual disease positive osteoporosis vertebral fracture present image took bone density measure disease positive lower distribution continuous value disease negative group determine threshold continuous variable best determining individual higher risk future fractures found lower value higher risk stata create table calculate sensitivity specificity different threshold person test positive value threshold wanted show graphical form decided make roc curve rocr package code comes didn make sense threshold calculated sensitivity specificity manually table least sensitive threshold sensitive additionally feel curve flipped diagonal axis know test poor figured issue due fact person test positive value threshold created new vector values flipped binary classification created roc plot got figure align better data threshold values opposite fundamentally wrong looking checked data times make sure wasn miscalculating sensitivity specificity values looks right thank edit working example
