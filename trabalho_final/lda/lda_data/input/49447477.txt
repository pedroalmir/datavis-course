niftynet selective sampler batch taken mix volume training volume selective sampler ensure sample taken roi due class imbalance random sample augmenting data scaling rotation flipping takes significant amount time sample created setting sample volume large value batch size niftynet iterations sample taken 1st volume switch samples taken 2nd volume sharp jump loss batch sample roughly mixture sample taken training volume tried setting sample volume roughly batch size samples reselected iteration slows iteration misunderstanding way ensure batches made sample mix training data thanks
