opening positron emission tomography pet dicom image matlab interpreting pixel values correctly new processing dicom image away native manufacturer software trying dicomread pet image set reconstructed transaxial slice matlab aim simple segmentation finally determine maximum minimum pixel value segment having trouble converting stored values value native system image loading matlab int16 class maximum pixel value regardless slouse load series know viewing image native system maximum pixel value slouse different checked rescale value rescale intercept values rescale relationship appears linear correction making assume corrections decay scatter random made reconstruction process help appreciated hopefully missing simple posted dicom info retrieved header don worry image phantom patient identifying data regards ross
