<p>By night I'm an internet vigilante, telling people who ignore climate change that they are wrong. Yes, I'm telling people on the internet they are wrong. I might need new hobbies.</p>

<p>For fun I like to ride my mountain bike, it's a GT Avalanche Comp 2015 hard tail, I also ride it on mountain trails when I get the chance, and even on downhill courses when I lack enough common sense not to.</p>

<p>I'm also an amateur astronomer, I have e 144mm wide Newtonian telescope that I use whenever I get the chance. Equatorial mounts are surprisingly precise and elegant by the way.</p>

<p>Hi there! I'm Ava. I'm a DevOps engineer in the healthcare industry. I'm also a beekeeper so if you see me running, try to keep up!<br>
On my spare time I like to craft different things, build websites and learn other languages.</p>

<p>As I look at the last 10 years, I see that I did quite a lot of work all kinds of computers. From fiddling with microcontrollers and assembler code to writing data processing scripts to physically assembling computer consoles.</p>

<p>The big step forward came when I <strong>learned to think about software in a structured, object-oriented way</strong>, as this allowed me to make software do things that I want it to do. Right now I'm <strong>proficient in two high level programming languages</strong> - Objective-C and Java and have touched just about every framework available for iOS. I've also became a hacker/maker and have completed a number of projects involving software and hardware.</p>

<p>Right now I'm in my early 30s and when I ask myself <strong>""What would I like to do in the next 10 years?""</strong>, my answer is ""something with the human brain"". The seeds are already there - I've picked up an interest in biology, cognitive science and neuroscience, enough to converse with real people. I've done first-hand research into sleep and made discoveries. I've taken classes in synthetic biology, performing manipulations on the bacteria genome. I've learned a lot about the neurotransmitter systems of the human brain, as well as how a biological organism develops.</p>

<p>It seems like there are a lot of similarities between the object-oriented concepts I use in the daily programming tasks and how biological organisms operate. This makes me hopeful that by the time I'm in my late 30s, I would be able to work and program some form of biological computer or just plain hack the human brain.</p>

I have also worked as a post doctoral researcher at University of Cagliari, Italy in the domain of Quality of Experience (QoE) based multimedia communication management and monitoring using Software-Defined Networks (SDN). Moreover, I have been working as a Marie Curie Early Stage Researcher (most prestigious research fellowship in Europe) for three years in a Marie Curie Horizon 2020 ITN called QoE-Net (<a href=""http://www.qoenet-itn.eu/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.qoenet-itn.eu/</a>). My doctoral studies consist of research in the domain of network monitoring and management using SDN for multimedia services. Also, I have recently developed an SDN platform for the QoE-aware traffic management of video streaming services. Furthermore, I have ten high impact factor publications in my credentials. Additionally, two of my research papers have been awarded best paper awards at IFIP/IEEE IM 2017 conference and IEEE Multimedia Technical Committee.</p>

<p>For the glory, for the money and for the fun. Mostly for the money!</p>

<p>Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.</p>

<p>IT errors are like snowflakes</p>

<p>They didn't drop the ball. They dropped the ball, kicked the coach in the nuts and took a crap in the quarterback's mouth</p>

<p>If they see a scrambled mass of code that looks like it was written by a bevy of drunken sailors, then they are likely to conclude that the same inattention to detail pervades every other aspect of the project</p>

During my PhD, I contributed and developed novel algorithms for 3D object modeling, visualization and shape statistical analysis. Since my 2014-15 post-doctoral fellowship at the Brigham Women's Hospital, I have used web technologies to develop new visualization tools for medical images and 3D objects in the browser as well as all the logic and infrastructure to handle thousands of images. 
I have contributed to the development of methods for statistical analysis in clinical studies. 
The Dental and Craniofacial Bionetwork for Image Analysis <a href=""https://dsci.dent.umich.edu"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DSCI</a>, is a platform to federate clinical and imaging data as well as computational methods for shape statistics. 
I have supervised the last 3 major releases of the <a href=""https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/dentistry-image-computing/Download"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Slicer Craniomaxillo Facial</a> software, as well as the development of plugins: ShapeVariationAnalyzer and Multivariate Functional Shape Data Analysis - MFSDA. Recently, I have started working with Dr. Stringer, in the Ultrasound Fetal Age Machine Learning Initiative (US-FAMLI) which aims to develop a low-cost obstetric ultrasound for use in low- and middle-income countries. The objective is to to use machine learning algorithms to estimate gestational age and make diagnoses without requiring a skilled ultrasonographer. I use state of the art neural network architectures to detect features in the images allowing measurement of fetal biometry structures, thus, predict gestational age.</p>

<p>As I look at the last 10 years, I see that I did quite a lot of work all kinds of computers. From fiddling with microcontrollers and assembler code to writing data processing scripts to physically assembling computer consoles.</p>

<p>The big step forward came when I <strong>learned to think about software in a structured, object-oriented way</strong>, as this allowed me to make software do things that I want it to do. Right now I'm <strong>proficient in two high level programming languages</strong> - Objective-C and Java and have touched just about every framework available for iOS. I've also became a hacker/maker and have completed a number of projects involving software and hardware.</p>

<p>Right now I'm in my early 30s and when I ask myself <strong>""What would I like to do in the next 10 years?""</strong>, my answer is ""something with the human brain"". The seeds are already there - I've picked up an interest in biology, cognitive science and neuroscience, enough to converse with real people. I've done first-hand research into sleep and made discoveries. I've taken classes in synthetic biology, performing manipulations on the bacteria genome. I've learned a lot about the neurotransmitter systems of the human brain, as well as how a biological organism develops.</p>

<p>It seems like there are a lot of similarities between the object-oriented concepts I use in the daily programming tasks and how biological organisms operate. This makes me hopeful that by the time I'm in my late 30s, I would be able to work and program some form of biological computer or just plain hack the human brain.</p>

<p>As I look at the last 10 years, I see that I did quite a lot of work all kinds of computers. From fiddling with microcontrollers and assembler code to writing data processing scripts to physically assembling computer consoles.</p>

<p>The big step forward came when I <strong>learned to think about software in a structured, object-oriented way</strong>, as this allowed me to make software do things that I want it to do. Right now I'm <strong>proficient in two high level programming languages</strong> - Objective-C and Java and have touched just about every framework available for iOS. I've also became a hacker/maker and have completed a number of projects involving software and hardware.</p>

<p>Right now I'm in my early 30s and when I ask myself <strong>""What would I like to do in the next 10 years?""</strong>, my answer is ""something with the human brain"". The seeds are already there - I've picked up an interest in biology, cognitive science and neuroscience, enough to converse with real people. I've done first-hand research into sleep and made discoveries. I've taken classes in synthetic biology, performing manipulations on the bacteria genome. I've learned a lot about the neurotransmitter systems of the human brain, as well as how a biological organism develops.</p>

<p>It seems like there are a lot of similarities between the object-oriented concepts I use in the daily programming tasks and how biological organisms operate. This makes me hopeful that by the time I'm in my late 30s, I would be able to work and program some form of biological computer or just plain hack the human brain.</p>

<p>As I look at the last 10 years, I see that I did quite a lot of work all kinds of computers. From fiddling with microcontrollers and assembler code to writing data processing scripts to physically assembling computer consoles.</p>

<p>The big step forward came when I <strong>learned to think about software in a structured, object-oriented way</strong>, as this allowed me to make software do things that I want it to do. Right now I'm <strong>proficient in two high level programming languages</strong> - Objective-C and Java and have touched just about every framework available for iOS. I've also became a hacker/maker and have completed a number of projects involving software and hardware.</p>

<p>Right now I'm in my early 30s and when I ask myself <strong>""What would I like to do in the next 10 years?""</strong>, my answer is ""something with the human brain"". The seeds are already there - I've picked up an interest in biology, cognitive science and neuroscience, enough to converse with real people. I've done first-hand research into sleep and made discoveries. I've taken classes in synthetic biology, performing manipulations on the bacteria genome. I've learned a lot about the neurotransmitter systems of the human brain, as well as how a biological organism develops.</p>

<p>It seems like there are a lot of similarities between the object-oriented concepts I use in the daily programming tasks and how biological organisms operate. This makes me hopeful that by the time I'm in my late 30s, I would be able to work and program some form of biological computer or just plain hack the human brain.</p>

<p>As I look at the last 10 years, I see that I did quite a lot of work all kinds of computers. From fiddling with microcontrollers and assembler code to writing data processing scripts to physically assembling computer consoles.</p>

<p>The big step forward came when I <strong>learned to think about software in a structured, object-oriented way</strong>, as this allowed me to make software do things that I want it to do. Right now I'm <strong>proficient in two high level programming languages</strong> - Objective-C and Java and have touched just about every framework available for iOS. I've also became a hacker/maker and have completed a number of projects involving software and hardware.</p>

<p>Right now I'm in my early 30s and when I ask myself <strong>""What would I like to do in the next 10 years?""</strong>, my answer is ""something with the human brain"". The seeds are already there - I've picked up an interest in biology, cognitive science and neuroscience, enough to converse with real people. I've done first-hand research into sleep and made discoveries. I've taken classes in synthetic biology, performing manipulations on the bacteria genome. I've learned a lot about the neurotransmitter systems of the human brain, as well as how a biological organism develops.</p>

<p>It seems like there are a lot of similarities between the object-oriented concepts I use in the daily programming tasks and how biological organisms operate. This makes me hopeful that by the time I'm in my late 30s, I would be able to work and program some form of biological computer or just plain hack the human brain.</p>

<p>I am looking to connect with entrepreneurs, adventurers and crazy dreamers who, just like me, want to put a dent in the universe. I am flexible on almost everything, and I really like to help others without looking for much in return. Ideally, you are based in Silicon Valley / SF Bay area so we can meet and have a nice conversation face to face. </p>

<p>To the best of my abilities, I am open to providing help: from technical advice to writing some code for you. If you need someone to share you the burden of launching your product, this could be me.</p>

<p>I started my coding journey in 2014 by learning Python. It felt like it opened a door to a whole new world of possibilities! I released a simple game called <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/black-white-a-colourful-grid-based-puzzle/id1102097118?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Black &amp; White</a> on the App Store that I had written in Python using the wonderful iOS Python IDE <a href=""http://omz-software.com/pythonista/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pythonista</a>.</p>

<p>I began learning to program for iOS as a side project late in 2009 when iPhone OS 3 was the latest and greatest!</p>

<p>In the Summer of 2010, I moved into a new role at a large research medical university hospital, where I was tasked with writing functionality for a SQL Server-based electronic medical record software suite. During this time, I continued writing iOS applications in the medical industry.</p>

<p>After working at this job for several years, I decided to strike out on my own. I am now the owner of a software consulting firm specializing in .NET Desktop development and iOS apps. I have professional relationships with several local businesses and two nationally-recognized research medical universities.</p>

I started my career within the University itself having undertaken research projects and participated in several research groups.</p>

<p>Previously the Technical Director at <a href=""https://www.whichledlight.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">whichledlight.com</a>, I was responsible for defining the technological strategy with our development team; assessing technical risk and mitigation planning whilst identifying weak software systems that need code improvement; establishing standards and procedures to track and measure project's progression; evaluating new technology and tools as opportunities for innovation and creating automated test processes for system features.</p>

<p>Now a software developer at <a href=""https://www.yourgolftravel.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Your Golf Travel</a> creating the best possible online experience for purchasing bespoke travel products. As part of the development team I am responsible for maintaining the infrastructure that sees over 300 thousand people travel on one of our holidays each year.</p>

I first learned how to program in Java and C# back at Bronx High School of Science. Recently at Hunter College I have studied different data structures in C++ and different database designs in SQL and NoSQL. I have discovered that I enjoy to learn and code in a variety of different languages. I love to learn about new technologies that address modern problems and how companies are transitioning to more efficient solutions.</p>

<p>In my free time, I develop mobile applications to learn and understand how professional applications are designed and developed. It is interesting to see an application and break it down from the eyes of its programmers. I developed a music streamer on iOS and Android. Currently I am working on a messaging app for iOS that utilizes SQL and PHP.</p>

<p>I believe the strongest part of a project, company, or goal is the team that works behind it. A team with strong members that share responsibility, work efficiently, and can express constructive criticism will exceed expectations. The product of my work must exceed my personal expectations and I will strive to do so for every future assignment.</p>

<p>I have a Bachelors in Computer Science from CUNY Hunter College.</p>

<p>I am interested in meeting colleagues and making new connections with individuals who can collaborate new ideas and share thoughts about a variety of topics. Please feel free to contact me.</p>

I am an academic; most of my time is spent doing research. I work on large-scale information management, an area that sounds terribly boring until you discover that my job lets me fly drones and go to music festivals for free. 
I also teach awfully bright students at the University of Sheffield. I teach advanced Web Technologies, another topic that looks horribly boring until you discover it is about doing cool things with Twitter and Facebook. 
Some of my undergrads have won competitions and even presented their results to the Prime Minister. Some of them have become PhD students and now are academics or researchers themselves. Others after their PhDs have become CEOs/CTOs and Chief Officers of companies we have created together. That probably means that I am old, because only old people can boast about the great achievements that their children have in life.</p>

<p>Programming-wise, I work mainly in Android (I have lead the development of a tracking app which has over 370,000 downloads) and Web technologies (e.g. Javascript, Nodejs, WebRTC and Cordova).</p>

<p>To be honest I always wanted to be a developer since I got my first computer when I was 7 years old. I loved to play games back then so I wanted to be a game developer. At 1st grade when the teacher asked us to draw what we want to be when we are grown up I drew a computer. So that's when it's started. Then I attended a programming study group throughout the elementary school where we learned the basics of Pascal and Comenius Logo. After that I went to a high school where I could learn informatics in an increased number of hours. There I met a wonderful teacher who thought us the really basics of programming: flow charts, structure charts, the default programming issues (i.e. select the largest element from an array, linear search, etc), and finally Pascal. Then I went to the university where I learned some advanced programming and a lot's of math :D. Then in 2010 I got my first iPhone, a 3GS! I loved the apps so I started to take a look at the iOS app development so I went to an iOS development course. And since I left university I'm working as a mobile developer!</p>

A <em>happy human</em> that loves being a <code>coder</code> over here!</p>

<p>I'm always eager to improve my skills and explore others points of view. I started to code in <strong>C++</strong> &amp; <strong>Java</strong> and, after several languages.., I'm now confortably stuck with <strong>Javascript</strong> and <strong>Swift</strong>. I'm in love with Agile, Docker and micro services (I'm trying to do it everything inside containers right now). I'm really curious, so I like to get a grasp of almost every disruptive technology... I guess I'm kind of a technological polygamist 😅. </p>

<p>Oh.. <strong>I enjoy teaching</strong>, I have been a 👨🏻‍🏫 several years and through StackOverflow I have had the opportunity to continue when not in the classroom.</p>

Years come, on summer 2013 I started my career at <a href=""http://www.mobindustry.net"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mobindustry Corp.</a> making <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fuel-my-run/id760205028"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fitness application</a>, <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/skyworks/id787377098"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">festival app</a>, <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/p-p-mgmt-project-people-management/id941161754"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">business catalog</a> and of course, <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fish-pictures/id894320179"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">social network</a>. </p>

<p>Thank to my <a href=""http://nmu.org.ua"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">home university's</a> program I had a chance to attend summer school at <a href=""https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/en?set_language=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Koblenz-Landau University</a>, this opportunity influenced on my mind and I decided to move somewhere, where I could continue develop myself as a person. </p>

<p>And, here I am in Bratislava.</p>

<p>Here I started master degree at <a href=""http://www.fei.stuba.sk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">STU FEI</a>. While studying I gained a lot of <a href=""https://github.com/braveS/sp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">system programming</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/braveS/feiArkanoid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenGL</a>, some <a href=""https://github.com/braveS/APZMOBV"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Android</a> stuff, <a href=""https://github.com/braveS/JavaClientSide"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Java</a> in general and experience working with Big Data.</p>

<p>Then I continued my career as iOS developer at <a href=""http://thirtyseventy.digital"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ThirtySeventy Digital</a>. And for 2.5 years I was part of the team developing IoT solution for Electrolux.</p>

<p>From august 2017 I started to work at <a href=""http://sygic.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sygic</a></p>

<p>As a person, I love helping people, always learning something new. </p>

I am an academic; most of my time is spent doing research. I work on large-scale information management, an area that sounds terribly boring until you discover that my job lets me fly drones and go to music festivals for free. 
I also teach awfully bright students at the University of Sheffield. I teach advanced Web Technologies, another topic that looks horribly boring until you discover it is about doing cool things with Twitter and Facebook. 
Some of my undergrads have won competitions and even presented their results to the Prime Minister. Some of them have become PhD students and now are academics or researchers themselves. Others after their PhDs have become CEOs/CTOs and Chief Officers of companies we have created together. That probably means that I am old, because only old people can boast about the great achievements that their children have in life.</p>

<p>Programming-wise, I work mainly in Android (I have lead the development of a tracking app which has over 370,000 downloads) and Web technologies (e.g. Javascript, Nodejs, WebRTC and Cordova).</p>

<ul>
<li>Happiness comes from pursuing excellence.  And occasionally blondes.</li>
<li>Happy clients write happy checks.  Unhappy ones may not write checks
at all.</li>
<li>Software is easy.  People are hard.</li>
<li>Never send an e-mail when you are angry.</li>
<li>You can tell somebody bad news in a good way.  It usually works out better.</li>
<li>Don't write code after 12 am, unless you are nocturnal.</li>
<li>If the answer doesn't come in an hour, walk away.</li>
<li>People are more important than money or things.  You would think this
would be obvious.</li>
<li>Nothing makes the software work like the hardware.</li>
<li>The bad push out the good (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">Gresham's Law</a> for people).  Unless
the good push back <strong>really hard</strong>.</li>
<li>I have no overt art skill.  All my art is in the code.  With my luck,
it will probably only be appreciated <strong>after</strong> I have died.</li>
<li>You are almost always writing code for others who are paying for it.  It costs less to be risk averse than code/object/tech happy.  You <strong>never</strong> want to be in a position of defending your vanity.</li>
<li>Your body prefers one side or the other to execute a spin kick (Dwi
Hoorigee).  Don't ever try it from your ""less than good""
side...you won't be fast and your opponent will clock you.</li>
<li>There is nothing in any video game I have ever played that is as real
or important as the world outside the computer. </li>
<li>Anyone who wants you for what you have won't stay around when you
don't have it.</li>
<li>The code is always <em>better</em> in my head than it is in the file.</li>
</ul>

<p>I write articles about things I think are interesting on my <a href=""http://www.nonlinearideas.com"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a>.  </p>

<p>I post complete code solutions (Cocos2d-x, Cocos2d) for things I write articles about <a href=""https://github.com/NonlinearIdeas?tab=repositories"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.  If I post it, feel free to use it.  Or abuse it.  It's all on you, baby!</p>

<p>“Gratitude is the ability to experience life as a gift. It liberates us from the prison of self-preoccupation.” –John Ortberg</p>

<p>“If you love a flower, don’t pick it up.
Because if you pick it up it dies and it ceases to be what you love.
So if you love a flower, let it be.
Love is not about possession.
Love is about appreciation.” 
―Osho</p>

<p>""Never be ashamed of what you feel. You have the right to feel any emotion that you want, and to do what makes you happy. That's my life motto."" –Demi Lovato</p>

After a hiatus, I've returned to software development.</p>

<p>I was a software developer the first 5 years after I received my CS degree from the U of Illinois in Champaign. I wrote commercial applications for newspapers for the PDP-8, PDP-11 and VAX while working for DEC, and then as a free-lancer for the HP-85, IBM PC and Apple ///. As part of a startup, I wrote the business database app Keystroke for the Apple /// and Lisa. Keystroke was a Macintosh launch app and ran (very slowly) off of diskette on the 128k Mac.</p>

<p>I spent the next several years in product marketing, support operations, channel operations, corporate marketing, and loyalty marketing. I was head of Apple's corporate presentation team and a product marketing manager there. I created and ran Logitech's worldwide loyalty marketing team. </p>

<p>I also have been a member of the founding team of several young companies as head of marketing. </p>

<p>Now I've gone back to my roots and I'm writing code again. My first app, Happy Now, is on the App Store, and I'm writing another new app for the healthcare industry. I'm open to help design and build a next great app with someone else.</p>

<p>For fun, I've done a lot of improv and standup comedy. I also play and watch basketball.</p>

My Work

<p>2015 - NOW
ASSISTANT RESERCHER, SHEBA TEL HASHOMER 
Deep learning to detect and predict cancer evolvement from sequential MRI images.
Since labeling MRI data requires excessive resources, I participated in 2 data since: 
Competitions that offer high quality, aurally labeled divers medical data:
•   Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2017.
The problem is a segmentation of 4 levels of cancer in MRI images.
Data and Results samples added below.
       <a href=""https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2017/data.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2017/data.html</a>
•   2018 Data Science Bowl, (Top 11 %)
The problem is a segmentation problem of nuclei in divergent microscope images.
<a href=""https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018</a>
Environment: Python, Keras, Theano, Nvidia GPU.</p>

<p>FREELANCE PROJECT

I sucked playing games, i was scared of every monster-invaded shooters etc. When the Internet appeared, i was amazed about how simply you can build your own playground being a webmaster.</p>

<p>HTML was so simple these days! I was very happy, that it didn't take years, nor months or weeks to learn the basis. 3 hours, and you could begin that virtual journey. That made me such a lazy person...</p>

<p>Laziness, though, has a good influence on programming. I always wanted a simple code to do great things - more thinking, less coding. I use that rule no matter if i develop new features to my very own CMS, other PHP/JS/AS projects or Android/iOS apps.</p>

<p>Personally i love jelly beans, snowboarding, and kicking Your ass in Battlefield 4 :)</p>

I believe @inithealth will find the way to make them really useful for society, which is the flaw in current use designs. We will find the key, for a healthier and better world.</p>

I believe @inithealth will find the way to make them really useful for society, which is the flaw in current use designs. We will find the key, for a healthier and better world.</p>

I first learned how to program in Java and C# back at Bronx High School of Science. Recently at Hunter College I have studied different data structures in C++ and different database designs in SQL and NoSQL. I have discovered that I enjoy to learn and code in a variety of different languages. I love to learn about new technologies that address modern problems and how companies are transitioning to more efficient solutions.</p>

<p>In my free time, I develop mobile applications to learn and understand how professional applications are designed and developed. It is interesting to see an application and break it down from the eyes of its programmers. I developed a music streamer on iOS and Android. Currently I am working on a messaging app for iOS that utilizes SQL and PHP.</p>

<p>I believe the strongest part of a project, company, or goal is the team that works behind it. A team with strong members that share responsibility, work efficiently, and can express constructive criticism will exceed expectations. The product of my work must exceed my personal expectations and I will strive to do so for every future assignment.</p>

<p>I have a Bachelors in Computer Science from CUNY Hunter College.</p>

<p>I am interested in meeting colleagues and making new connections with individuals who can collaborate new ideas and share thoughts about a variety of topics. Please feel free to contact me.</p>

Initially my basic skills related to Object Pascal/Delphi. Later I worked on self-education and got a lot of skills in other branches. There were such technologies and platforms as ASP, Java, MSSQL, Oracle, MySQL, PostreSQL, php, JSP, C#, Objective-C. I find them all very interesting and useful for certain kinds of tasks.
At present moment my primary objective is iOS development.</p>

<p>“Gratitude is the ability to experience life as a gift. It liberates us from the prison of self-preoccupation.” –John Ortberg</p>

<p>“If you love a flower, don’t pick it up.
Because if you pick it up it dies and it ceases to be what you love.
So if you love a flower, let it be.
Love is not about possession.
Love is about appreciation.” 
―Osho</p>

<p>""Never be ashamed of what you feel. You have the right to feel any emotion that you want, and to do what makes you happy. That's my life motto."" –Demi Lovato</p>

<p>""A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself."" –Josh Billings</p>

<p>I've been working since 2015 exclusively on iOS projects: from Objective-C, through all the multiple Swift and Xcode versions. I've dealt with legacy Objective-C code, and also created apps from scratch using Swift and clean architectures like VIPER, MVVM+RxSwift.   </p>

<p>I do like Unit Testing, and I make it part of my development process in those projects that meet the requirements. I have experience with Firebase: Authentication, Realtime Database, Cloud Firestore, Could Functions, Analytics, Deep Links.</p>

Over 9 years of experience in software development and technical leadership with much of it in the Enterprise mobile and server side space. The majority of my mobile career has been based in iOS and Android but I have worked with other wearables as well such as headsets.   The majority of my server side experience has been in Java Spring, Python, and Node.js.  </p>

<p>When I am not at work I also enjoy coding, writing, researching in my free time. The Chicagoland area has a lot of excellent meetups and I enjoy attending mobile, C/C++, and network engineering meetups throughout area when possible. I also try to contribute to open source as much as possible with recent contributions to CPython and TCPDump.  Researching new developments in mobile and in wireless communication and security is one of my favorite topics.  I am always looking to learn more about mobile device connectivity and the networks they run on.</p>

<p>What drives me as an engineer and a technical leader is education and the collaborative growth that you get from working with a team of other talented engineers.  I always am looking for an opportunity to better educate myself and grow in my career!</p>
