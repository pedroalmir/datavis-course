currently working dicom files contain dicom dose delivery data structure set files mainly interested structure set file rtss dcm contains set contour points roi interest particular contour points surround tumor volume instance tumor set contours contour set points encircle slice tumor trying matlab contour points construct tumor volume binary matrix nontumor tumor help possible approach fill contour set binary slice interpolate volume slices fill patch function create binary cross sections contour slice having difficulty figuring interpolate binary slices volume built functions appear apply particular problem wrong simple linear interpolation doesn appropriate edges contour blend adjacent contour directions option take points tesselate making slices don know make matlab tesselate surface tumor intersecting tumor volume currently find triangles tumor surface sure take convert binary matrix volume experience slice interpolation tesselation techniques apply relevant toolkits exist stuck open approaches languages familiar python assumed matlab handle matrix operations easier thanks advance
