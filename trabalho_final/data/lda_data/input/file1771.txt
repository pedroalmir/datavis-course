silverlight application trying decode dicom images compressed jpeg transfer syntax fjcore class library dicom images normally compressed bit precision trying decode image original fjcore source code saying unsupported codec type original fjcore implementation sof baseline dct sof progressive dct start frame markers supported change implementation accept sof marker extended sequential dct treat sof frames way sof frames images decoded bits accounted typical bit precision image looks decoding modified fjcore library ideally image look able tell fjcore implementation image precision recorded jpegframe class original fjcore implementation fully support grayscale images bit precision planning take bull horns try extend fjcore support bit precision grayscale images thought pose question stackoverflow encountered solved problem case happy learn solved problem thanks advance anders cureos
