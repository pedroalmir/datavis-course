working evaluating screening test osteoporosis large set data measured values bone density classified individuals disease positive osteoporosis vertebral fracture present images took bone density measure disease positive lower distribution continuous value disease negative group determine threshold continuous variable best determining individual higher risk future fractures found lower value higher risk stata create tables calculate sensitivity specificity different thresholds person test positive value threshold made table wanted show graphical form decided make roc curve rocr package code comes expected didn make sense thresholds calculated sensitivity specificity manually table least sensitive threshold sensitive additionally feel curve flipped diagonal axis know test poor figured issue due fact person test positive value threshold created new vector values flipped binary classification created roc plot got figure aligns better data threshold values opposite fundamentally wrong looking checked data times make sure wasn miscalculating sensitivity specificity values looks right thanks edit working example
