training three volumes selective sampler ensure samples taken roi due class imbalance random samples augmenting data scaling rotation flipping takes significant amount time samples created setting sample volume large value batch size niftynet iterations samples taken volume switch samples taken volume sharp jump loss batch samples roughly mixture samples taken training volumes tried setting sample volume roughly batch size samples reselected iteration slows iteration misunderstanding way ensure batches made samples mix training data thanks
